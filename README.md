# ML4kids-iOS
An iOS version of the web app I created earlier. 
This app has a canvas where kids can write their answers to the prompt math questions and can check if the answer matched with the one given in the prompt.

This project uses:
# CoreML, MNIST Classifier model for handwritten digits and the Vision framework.
